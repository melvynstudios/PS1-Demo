# 3d Graphics

- Vertex, are points in space, (x, y, z)
- Polygon face is defined by connecting vertices.
  - Quad faces are defined by 4 vertices
	- Triangle faces are defined by 3 vertices

## Projection

- Perspective projection, used for 3d graphics, field of view.
- Orthographic projection, used for 2d graphics, screen size.

### Perspective projection

**Perspective divide:**  Xscreen = Xworld / z    and    Yscreen = Yworld / z

The GTE does this quickly for us on the PS1.
